> AI-managed SSH connections with a live multi-tab terminal panel for DeepSeek Harness.

SSH terminal panel + AI connection manager for DeepSeek Harness (DSH).

The AI agent can autonomously create, address, and tear down SSH connections
right from the conversation (`ssh_connect` / `ssh_exec` / `ssh_list` /
`ssh_status` / `ssh_disconnect` / `ssh_exec_read` / `ssh_exec_kill` /
`ssh_delete`), while a XShell/Uniterm-style multi-tab terminal panel in the
Web GUI shows every command — model and human — in real time on the same
screen.

## Compatibility

Verified working as published on **DSH `0.2.0-rc.2`** with the **PC desktop client
(Windows, Electron)** as well as the browser-served Web UI. Verified 2026-09-30.

`0.5.0` as published does not run there. Three defects are fixed on this branch:

1. **Activation aborted on every client.** `apply()` called
   `ctx.settings.register(name, Config, opts)`, removed in DSH 0.2.0-rc.2, so no
   tools were registered and `/ssh/ws` was never mounted. The row config now comes
   from `apply(ctx, config)`.
2. **The WebSocket URL was built from the wrong origin.** The desktop client serves
   the document from its own privileged origin (`dsh-app://app/`), where
   `window.location.host` is `app`, so the plugin dialled an unresolvable address.
   It now uses `__DSH_TRANSPORT__.streamBaseUrl`, the source built-in clients use.
3. **The trust fence rejected the desktop shell.** The upgrade was refused with
   `403` because the shell's `Origin` (`dsh-app://app`) can never equal the `Host`
   authority. That single harness-owned origin is now accepted; every other
   rejection is unchanged.

Symptom if you run the unpatched `0.5.0`: a red link indicator, an empty
saved-connection list despite records existing on the Host, and every action failing
with `panel link not ready`.

## Features

- **Model-driven connection lifecycle** — the agent connects by name or by
  parameters, runs commands with exit codes and readable failures, lists and
  inspects AI-managed connections, disconnects and deletes them. The same
  server may hold several independent connections (each with its own name,
  session state and command queue).
- **Auto-save & reuse** — every connection is persisted by name (globally
  unique). After a DSH restart, `ssh_exec` on a saved
  name automatically re-establishes the connection from its saved settings.
- **Unified AI management** — there is no source distinction: every saved
  connection, whether created by the AI (`ssh_connect`) or from the Settings
  page, is managed by the AI agent. It appears in `ssh_list` and is
  immediately addressable by `ssh_exec` / `ssh_status` / `ssh_disconnect` /
  `ssh_delete` — no transfer step exists or is needed.
- **Keep-alive & reconnect** — idle keep-alive per connection; **automatic
  reconnect only for unexpected drops** (network blips, server resets) with
  exponential backoff (bounded attempts); **every explicit disconnect stays
  down** (tab close, `ssh_disconnect`, Settings "Disconnect" button). A
  "reconnected — the shell state was reset" notice is shown after an
  automatic reconnect.
- **Execution mutex (every connection)** — while an AI command runs on a
  connection, human keystrokes are dropped server-side with a visible "AI is
  executing…" hint (the user may only type when the AI is not executing on
  that terminal); a model `ssh_exec` against a connection whose shared
  terminal shell is still active waits until the shell falls quiet (no
  output/input for `shellQuietWaitMs`, default 2 s) or returns a readable
  "busy" result instead of interleaving output.
- **Tab semantics** — closing a tab disconnects immediately (no confirmation
  dialog); AI `ssh_disconnect` keeps the tab open showing "disconnected" (one
  click to reconnect); a model connect that has no tab re-opens one
  automatically. Connecting a saved connection (tab bar **"+**", the
  Settings-page Connect button) **never rejects an already-open connection**:
  when a tab for that connection is already open, the call opens a FRESH
  independent session in a new tab — even when the same connection is already
  connected in another tab — and only connects the primary session (the one
  the model tools address) when no tab is open yet.
- **Live terminal panel — two surfaces, one state** — the panel body can
  live in **DSH's native right details column** (the conversation shrinks
  instead of being covered; closing restores the original right column
  untouched; a slim SSH rail on the right edge reopens it) **or inside
  [dsh-better-sidebar](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar)**:
  when that plugin is installed, the same panel body registers as a sidebar
  tab (`dsh-ssh:terminal` — visible in its **+** menu, with a live
  connection-count badge), and the AI-connect auto-open lands there (opening
  and expanding the sidebar). Both surfaces share the one host-managed state
  stream, so switching never forks the terminals. `panelSurface` (see
  settings below) chooses the surface: `auto` (default — sidebar when
  installed), `sidebar` (prefer sidebar), `native` (always the built-in
  column). Without dsh-better-sidebar everything falls back to the native
  column automatically. Each connection owns **one real interactive shell
  (PTY)**: the
  login banner (motd / Last login), the remote prompt `user@host:path$`,
  input echo and `cd` updates all come from the remote shell, exactly like a
  native SSH client. There is **no input box and no copy control** — click
  the terminal and type; keystrokes go straight into the remote shell
  (arrows, Tab, Ctrl-C, paste, IME supported). A blinking block cursor shows
  while the terminal is focused. AI-run commands appear in the same
  scrollback with source tags. Multi-tab, ANSI colors, scrollback. The view
   stays pinned to the newest output as it arrives — even large output bursts
   follow to the bottom; scrolling up to read history is respected (no forced
   jump), but whenever the AI starts operating the connection the terminal
   slides back to the bottom so the AI's live output is visible.
- **Settings page** — "SSH Connections" under Settings manages everything:
  create, edit (rename supported), delete connections and their credentials
  (passwords / private keys stored in the DSH credential store), and
  connect/disconnect. The terminal column itself contains no CRUD.
- **Credential hygiene** — passwords and private keys live in the DSH
  credential store under generated references; the records file, logs and
  tool results never contain secret material; inline secrets in tool
  arguments are rejected with guidance; auth failures return scrubbed,
  readable reasons.
- **Settings** — the `dsh-ssh` settings namespace (heartbeat, reconnect
  policy, timeouts, output caps, records path) can be overridden through the
  DSH settings system / profile patch.
- **Bilingual UI** — Chinese and English copy.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18 (ESM)
- pnpm (lockfile: `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- A DeepSeek Harness (DSH) installation with the `web` profile
- For the test suite: a reachable SSH server (the included tests target a
  local WSL OpenSSH instance; see `scripts/test-acceptance.mjs`)

## Install into a profile

```bash
# from npm (recommended)
dsh plugin --profile web add @jmcc-guo/dsh-ssh

# or directly from GitHub
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:jmcc-guo/dsh-ssh#v0.5.0"

# or from a local checkout
dsh plugin --profile web add <path-to-this-repo>
```

The bundle patch (`cordis.patch.yml`) mounts the `dsh-ssh` row. Override
config in the profile patch with the same row id:

```yaml
- id: dsh-ssh
  config:
    heartbeatIntervalMs: 20000
    reconnectMaxAttempts: 8
    outputLimitBytes: 2097152
```

Restart the profile process afterwards (plugin-set changes and the client
bundle graph are composed at boot).

## Troubleshooting

### ssh2 is bundled — no build steps needed

`ssh2` and its full dependency closure are shipped **bundled inside the
package** (`bundleDependencies`), so installing `@jmcc-guo/dsh-ssh` never runs
dependency build scripts: no `allowBuilds` edits, no
`ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`. ssh2 runs on its pure-JS implementation, which is
fully functional (verified against a real SSH server); the optional native
crypto binding is intentionally not compiled.

### Peer-dependency warnings

`pnpm peers check` may report "missing peer" for the `@deepseek-ai/*` packages
even though DSH provides them: with the hoisted profile layout, external
plugins resolve host packages at runtime from the shared `profiles/node_modules`
tree, which pnpm's static peer check does not cross. The warnings are benign —
the plugin loads fine (verified at runtime).

## Settings namespace (`dsh-ssh`)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `heartbeatIntervalMs` | 30000 | ssh2 keep-alive interval |
| `keepaliveCountMax` | 3 | keep-alive failures before the connection is considered dead |
| `connectTimeoutMs` | 15000 | SSH handshake / TCP connect timeout |
| `reconnectBaseDelayMs` | 2000 | first auto-reconnect delay (doubles per attempt) |
| `reconnectMaxDelayMs` | 60000 | backoff cap |
| `reconnectMaxAttempts` | 5 | max automatic reconnect attempts |
| `execTimeoutMs` | 120000 | default `ssh_exec` completion wait |
| `busyWaitTimeoutMs` | 20000 | default mutex wait when the connection is busy |
| `reconnectWaitTimeoutMs` | 30000 | default wait while reconnecting |
| `shellQuietWaitMs` | 2000 | shared-shell silence required before AI may run |
| `outputLimitBytes` | 1048576 | per-connection terminal buffer cap |
| `execOutputMaxBytes` | 200000 | cap on output returned to the model per command |
| `recordsPath` | `$DSH_HOME/storages/dsh-ssh/connections.json` | records file override |
| `panelSurface` | `auto` | where the Web panel lives: `auto` = dsh-better-sidebar when installed, else the native column; `sidebar` = prefer dsh-better-sidebar (falls back to native when absent); `native` = always the built-in details column. Applied live to open panels |

## Model tools

- `ssh_connect` — create a new connection (host/port/user + auth by
  credential reference or key file path) or re-establish an existing one.
- `ssh_exec` — run a command on a saved connection by name; auto-reconnects
  when offline, waits through reconnect/busy states (with timeouts), returns
  output + exit code; long commands return an `execId` for
  `ssh_exec_read` / `ssh_exec_kill`.
- `ssh_exec_read` — incremental output of a running (or finished) command.
- `ssh_exec_kill` — terminate a running command (SIGINT through the pty).
- `ssh_list` — all saved connections with live status (every connection is
  AI-managed).
- `ssh_status` — detailed status of one saved connection.
- `ssh_disconnect` — explicit disconnect (no auto-reconnect; optional
  `delete`); the panel tab stays open showing "disconnected".
- `ssh_delete` — delete a saved connection record (disconnects first).

**Secret rule for the model:** never pass passwords or private keys inline in
tool arguments (they are recorded verbatim in the session log and rejected).
Use `auth.passwordRef` / `auth.privateKeyRef` (a stored credential or
environment variable) or `auth.privateKeyPath` (a key file on the host).
New secrets can be stored through the panel's connection form, which routes
them into the DSH credential store.

## Security notes

- The panel channel (`/ssh/ws`) applies the harness browser-trust fence:
  loopback/trusted-host Host, same-origin Origin, cross-site fetch-metadata
  rejection.
- Secrets never leave the credential store: the records file holds
  references only; error messages are scrubbed; logs contain no secrets.
- Commands run through real PTYs on the remote host: ANSI output works,
  interactive programs work, and termination is a genuine SIGINT to the
  foreground process group. User keystrokes flow through the shared shell's
  PTY; while an AI command runs on a connection the host drops keystrokes
  (input mutex — the user may only type when the AI is not executing on that
  terminal).
